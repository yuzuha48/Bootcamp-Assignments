## Users CRUD Modularized 👤

Maintain users with CRUD
- 🧑 A new user can be created as long as certain conditions are met (first and last name must be at least 2 characters, email not associated with existing user, etc.); an error message will appear if the conditions are not met
- 🏠 Upon clicking on the "Home" link, all users' information (id, full name, email, etc.) will be displayed as well as some actions that can be taken on each user (show, edit, delete)
- ℹ️ Clicking on "Show" will display a card with the user's information
- ✏️ Clicking on "Edit" will allow changes to be made to the user's information
- 🗑️ Clicking on "Delete" will delete the user
