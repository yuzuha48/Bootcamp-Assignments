## Great Number Game 🎲

The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100 in 5 tries or less. 
- 🚫 They will be told if their guess is too high or too low in a red message box. 
- ✅ If they guess correctly, they will be told they're correct in a green message box, and they will be prompted to add their name to the leaderboard. Upon submission, they will see the other users who guessed correctly and the number of tries it took them to guess the correct number. 
- 😔 However, if the user doesn't guess the correct number in 5 tries or less, they will recieve a "You lose" message in a red box and have the option to try again.
