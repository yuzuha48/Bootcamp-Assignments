## Ninja Gold 💛

- 🏆 The user will be prompted to specify their win conditions (how much gold they want to collect in how many moves) 
- 🏠 The user can then choose from 4 different places to earn (or potentially lose) gold.
- 🧮 Upon "visiting" a place, the user will be informed of how much gold they earned or lost. 
- 🥠 The user will then see a "You lost..." or "You won!" sign depending on whether or not they were able to reach their goal, and they will be have the option to play again.
