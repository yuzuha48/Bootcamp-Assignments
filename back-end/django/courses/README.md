## Courses 🏫

* 📚 The root route displays a form to add a new course and a table displaying all courses. For each of the courses in the table, there are a set of action links. 
* ➕ A new course can be added with a name and a description (validations included). Upon submission, the course will be added to the table displaying all courses. 
* 🗑️ Selecting the "remove" action leads to a page that asks for confirmation that the user wants to delete the course. If the user selects "yes," the course will be deleted. If the user selects "no," they will be routed back to the root page.   
* 💬 Selecting the "comment" action leads to a page with a form to add a new comment and a list of all comments. When a new comment is submitted (validations included), the comment will be added to the list of all comments.
